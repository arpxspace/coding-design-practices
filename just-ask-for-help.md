just ask for help

- when you have an issue, you want to try do it yourself for many reason:
  - you take defeat in seeking others assistance
  - you lose confidence in your own abilities
  - you dont want to bother people and take up much of their time
  - you feel its not a good use of time as you would have to explain the whole context and history that you had personally ingrained to this point to said person
  - you might end up not getting a fix

whats the alternative?
  - going down the wrong approach and spending time all to have to refactor everything again
  - not being able to refactor well because you feel defeated and less energized to complete the task.
  - the second time round implementation will work but may take longer and be worse
  - still losing confidence in your own abilities as you go over the deadline of getting a task done
  - you bother people by not getting the work done in a suitable time

key points:
  - its always worth asking someone. sometimes even the process of rubber duckying lets you untangle the cognitive load you are holding on to and clarify any misconceptions you had. essentially you run a debugger yourself by going through it with someone. 

question is how do you make it a habit? Most importantly how do you know WHEN is a right time to seek help. do certain things need to be checked off? perhaps some form of framework here would be useful; questions that you ask yourself.

to notice when you need to ask for help:
  - you feel frustrated
  - you feel you arent making progress
  - you feel you have to start again often
  - you dont feel confident in the approach youve taken

when asking for help:
  - walkthrough and even tell yourself how the flow is for a task
