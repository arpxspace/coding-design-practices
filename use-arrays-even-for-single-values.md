usually having a value for a single varialbe can be quite **constraining**. requirements can change and having to refactor references of this variables use across the codebase can be a pain. 

>>> Only issue is DX being reduced due to more boilerplate in working with an array of 1 element which wouldbe been easier with just a single variable. however some form of DSL or utilities could aim to alleviate this. A list/array can be dynamic enough where you can expand it above 1 element but can still host only 1 element.
